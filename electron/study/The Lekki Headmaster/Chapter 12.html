    was billed to jet out with the  Emirates airline on Saturday at 10pm.
    He  went early due to his British Airways experience where he turned

    landlord, Mr Ogunwale, wife and grand children Jide and Kemi had a
    cordial relationship with him, so much so the landlord volunteered to
    drive him to the airport in his Honda Pilot. In his free time he has

    History. While preparing to travel, he had made sure to pack some
    Nigerian groceries, sold his Pathfinder SUV for 1.5 million to Jeremi
    Amos, the accountant and gifted his freezer and other electronics to
    his landlady. At least four of Stardom's teachers offered to see him

    jeans, he prepared to travel after his company had left. He soon
    dozed off and dreamt of slavery.</font></p>

    at Stardom, he is sorely missed and while the whole school was trying
    to adjust to a new life without him, he emerges again, saying he
    won't be leaving and loved it there. This prompts a rousing victory
    song of the school which concludes the story.</font></p>
