was trying to say his night prayer in his Adeniyi Jones home in Ikeja
when Mrs Ignatius' call came in, in the dead of the night complaining
of her husband's absence. The book takes us back to Bepo's physical
description, complexion and dynamic nature. The story goes back to
the Ignatius family as we are informed of how a DNA test reveals that
one of their three children, Favour, was not fathered by Mr Ignatius.
This was after the whole family had prepared for the relocation. He
would later muse on one of his favourite stories, which was the
sacking of Mr Ayesoro, the Government teacher. who was sacked or
transferred to the property wing of the Stardom organisation,because
Bibi Ladele had a nightmare about him.</font></p>
