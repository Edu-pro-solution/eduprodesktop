    >The chapter opens on legal tussle between two families with children named
    Banky and Tosh. We are made to know that the school encourages a democratic
    process by election in choosing their prefects. Forms are first obtained
    after which comes a screening by management. On the Speech Day which was one
    of the process involved in the selection of prefects, Banky had called Tosh
    the son of an ex-convict, which led to an uproar. We are made to know that
    their rivalry went as far as JSS3, and their parents. All these made Bepo
    feel both families were irreconcilable. The chapter closed on the 5 year old
    ‘Breath Project’ that he was worried about and how he'd do everything in his
    power to be available for the launch.</font
