<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:serif;">Chapter Six</span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">All the students read for their last exam in the university; Moral Philosophy. Well, everyone except people like Salma who decided not to attend the class or read their textbooks. Salma especially believes that since the exam questions for the past three years has been repeated without fail, she believes it will be the same that year. So, she studies only the questions in preparations for her examination.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">On the exam day, Salma was elegantly dressed, a move which draws a lot of attention to her. To her surprise though, there is no repeat of questions so she has nothing to write. This also increases the attention she draws to herself because she is the only one who for the first 30 minutes, doesn't write anything. </span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">Next to her is a very brilliant student, Kolawole Abdul who after a lot of silent pleading, decides to help Salma. While the invigilator is not watching, he scribbles some answers in a paper and passes it to her. Immediately, Salma begins to write in her answer booklet as fast as she can. This move gives her away as the female invigilator finds it suspicious that someone who has written nothing in the last 30 minutes now suddenly has a lot to write. She catches Salma with the cheat notes and asks her to fill in the malpractice form. After that, she is left to complete her examination. After the exam, she is ushered to the current HOD's Office. All of Salma's prayers on her way there are unanswered and her hopes dashed as the HOD immediately asks that her issue should be sent to the Exams and Ethics Committee which acts as the Disciplinary Tribunal on matters of examination malpractice.</span></p><br>
