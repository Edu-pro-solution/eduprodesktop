    >Ummi watches her daughters as they await their father's return from the
    only bank in the village where he works as an accountant. She watches on in
    admiration as her youngest child, Bint, narrates to her siblings the uproar
    she causes when she asks her Social Studies teacher about a question in
    French which he didn't have an answer to. Ummi, being a teacher, joins in
    the conversation, urging jokingly that the man be given a break. They all
    share a close family bond filled with morals, respect and fun.</span

    >Omar, the first child and only son announces to the family that he has been
    offered an admission to the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, to study Law.
    Ummi believes her husband will be thrilled and there will be a grand
    celebration, as Law is his passion before circumstances made him study
    Accountancy instead. Omar urges his siblings to allow him the opportunity to
    break the news to his father himself, as he has been promised a new android
    phone if he secures the admission. The news of Omar's success is received
    with cheers and teasing while they all move to the front of the house,
    waiting for Omar's father.</span

    >They start discussing amidst rounds of Zobo drinks when Ummi is asked to
    tell a story. She thinks about her son's latest achievement and the changes
    this will bring to his life. He will have to move to a new environment where
    there is enough freedom, people from all walks of life, and a lot of other
    experiences. She decides to tell Omar and his siblings the story of her
    university days and how it changed her, hoping it will serve as a didactic
    piece to the 18 year old boy who is about to start another phase of his
    life.</span
