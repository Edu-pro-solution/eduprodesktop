<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:serif;">Chapter Three</span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">Ummi continues her narration about what happens when she returned home, after she completed her registration. </span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">Having realised her mistake caused by her misconception about her HOD, Ummi pleads with her husband to apologise to the man on her behalf. Then, the husband goes ahead goes ahead to narrate how his day goes to. There, Ummi tells her children the story of the quiet one, just as her husband narrates to her. She hopes to use the story to teach her children, especially Omar that people can't be trusted and can't be judged by what they look or act like because nothing is what it seems to be.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;"> </span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">The quiet one, whose name is Talle, is born after so many years of his parent's childlessness. He gets his name, Talle, from the fact that his mum dies after his birth and is nicknamed 'the Quiet One' because he is so reserved and keeps to himself, an attribute of his that becomes extreme when he loses his father and stepmother in a car crash. He works as a driver at the local government office and is very religious. He is a resident of Lafayette just like Ummi and her husband. In this small community, everyone is known, especially Talle who has a routined life. </span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">Thus, it is quite easy for the market women to suspect Talle is involved in something secretive when he starts buying more than the usual portions of foodstuff he used to buy. One of the market women reports Talle to the District Head who summons him for questioning. No sooner has he arrived than some policemen show up to arrest him, having found his accomplice with whom he commits the crime of kidnapping and extortion. Apparently, Talle alongside Zaki kidnaps a thirteen year old boy, in order to get ransom from his rich father. The boy has to be fed, which explains the extra portion of foodstuff Talle has been buying lately. Talle is eventually sentenced to jail term with hard labour. After the story, Ummi points out to her children that despite the fact that Talle acts all innocent and calm, he still had the capability to carry out such deadly act. So, humans cannot be trusted based on how they look.</span></p><br>
