<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:serif;">Chapter Seven</span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">Salma has been summoned to the Committee which will sit in a week to decide her fate. She is desperate. She is ready to do anything to remain on campus and get her certificate so she goes to Honourable Habib for help. He offered to talk to Doctor Dapo, who is now a professor, on her behalf but considering her last encounter with him in 100 level, she tells him not do. She asks for money instead to bribe the Chairman of the Exams and Ethics Committee. She learnt that the man will do anything, provided money is involved. In exchange for 200,000 or 300,000 naira, Salma agrees to have sex with Habib, ignoring the fact that she is in a relationship with his driver and he is also dating her friend, Tomiwa.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">The meeting point with the Committee Chairman, Dr. Mohammed Kabir is a hotel where he offers to have sex with her but she refuses. She offered him 100,000 naira and promised to seal it up with sex after he gets her out of the mess. It turns out Dr. Kabir is not The Chairman of the Committee. In fact, he isn't one of the other four members. Salma comes to this realisation on the day of the hearing and knows she is done for. She gets angry, starts to give sarcastic and insulting remarks and lastly she implicates Kolawole who gives her the cheat notes during the exam. As a result, he is expelled together with Salma.</span></p><br>
