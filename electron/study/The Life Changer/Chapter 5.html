She gives them Tomiwa's number instead so Tomiwa goes the next time, posing as Salma. The men turn out to be a politician and his driver.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">Habib, the honourable, quickly points it out to Tomiwa that she is not the girl he first meets so she reveals her identity. The fact that she impersonates her friend doesn't bother Habib as he already takes a liking to Tomiwa's feisty spirit, her courage and will to express herself. He gives her 20,000 naira and 10,000 each for her roommates. Then, he sends Labaran, his driver to buy her lots of grocery then sends her on her way.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">Tomiwa returns to the hostel and shares all the money and grocery with her friends. They are all happy but this was short-lived by Salma who starts to regret her decision of sending Tomiwa off to the men instead of going herself. A heated argument ensues but it soon ends, and they go back to their feast of chicken and suya. Salma however resolves to date Labaran, the Honourable's driver, since the Honourable now has eyes for Tomiwa. </span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">These four roommates are all brilliant students who do very well in their studies, despite studying different courses. They get to their final year and are about to write their last paper, Moral Philosophy which is a General Studies paper. This was when things start getting awry for Salma.</span></p><br>
