<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:serif;">Chapter Four</span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">Doctor Dabo is the 100 level coordinator in Salma's department. He is a disciplined man but when he sees Salma come into his office to complete her registration, all sense of discipline eludes him as he makes advances towards her. Salma who is not having any of that, insults him and leaves his office. Afterwards, he blames himself, praying to God that Salma doesn't report him to the school authorities, thereby jeopardising his career.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">Salma completed her hostel registration and gets three roommates, all chosen at random in the balloting process. They are Tomiwa, Ada, and Ngozi. Contrary to Salma's expectations, they turn out to be nice persons, despite the diversity in their cultural backgrounds and religion. They become best of friends and food mostly seals their bond. </span></p><br>
