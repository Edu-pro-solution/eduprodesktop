Her father gives her a condition that she must get married before resumption so she gets married. A lot of things seem new to Ummi who enters a university campus for the first time; the dressing and carefree attitude as well as the people. She meets Salma, a fair young lady who wears a lot of tight and revealing clothing, in contrast to the loose clothing which covers all of Ummi's body except her face, in compliance with her religious demands. </span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">Their first encounter is at the Faculty Registration Office where Salma, not knowing she is addressing the lecturer they have all been waiting for, voices out her opinion about lecturers whom she believes are corrupt, always wanting money from guys and sex from ladies before doing their jobs. </span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">From the Registration Office, Ummi headed to her HOD's office to get her matriculation number. He acts friendly, compliments her dressing and makes her feel comfortable. This makes Ummi think he is trying to hit on her so she becomes angry and defensive. When she gets home and narrates this to her husband, she gets to know her HOD is her husband's friend who is helpful in securing her admission, hence the reason for his friendliness.</span></p><br>
