<p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:serif;">Chapter Eight</span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">Mohammed Kabir who dupes Salma is not who he seems to be. He is a lab attendant in the school. Though he is cheerful when around people, his life is sad and hollow so he resorts to gambling. Having heard about how he obtained money by false pretence from Salma, Labaran decides to teach him a lesson. He informs Habib of his plan to use Zaki for the job and we get a flashback to Talle and Zaki who are involved in kidnapping some years back. </span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">Apparently, Zaki works for Habib and has been asked to kidnap the boy so as to teach his father a lesson. He involved Talle who blows their cover and they both get arrested. Contrary to the information given to the District Head about Talle's imprisonment, he is freed after Habib pays a huge amount to the police. Since then, Talle has been living in a small village on the borders of Nigeria and Niger.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">Both Habib and Labaran agree to use Zaki to teach Dr. Kabir a lesson so they engage his services. Zaki traces Kabir to a gambling spot where he just wins 300,000 naira and decides to call it a day. This infuriates Kartagi, the leader of the gambling group who sends one of his thugs to follow Kabir as he leaves and teach him some manners. Gamblers are not supposed to leave the table unless they lost or the game is off. The thug follows Kabir and Zaki who has been lurking in the shadows does the same. The thug attacks Kabir first but Zaki takes him out. Zaki beats Kabir seriously until he passes out and also robs him of the money he has.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">Zaki takes the money to Labaran who decides not to give an account of that to Habib. After giving 50,000 naira to Zaki for a job well done, Labaran decides to keep the rest. This is because he believes Habib will not expect Kabir to have any money. Also, Labaran suspects that the money Habib gives to Salma must have been in exchange for something like sexual intercourse, so this money will serve as his compensation for sleeping with his girlfriend.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:serif;">Before all these and while Salma is still in the university, her father dies. This makes her outlook towards life changed a bit. She becomes decent and serious with her life. So, she gets in a serious relationship with Salim and gets engaged to him. </span></p>
