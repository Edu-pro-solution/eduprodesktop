Naturally, Nigeria pidgin appears to be the first choice of most Nigerians in informal situations, especially when they are among those from different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds, English inclusive, Nigerian pidgin could be said to be the most widely spoken. Evidence abounds in motor parks, parties, congregations and most social occasions. There is also ample evidence in the electronic and print media, especially in political propaganda, campaigns and product advertisement. Thus, in terms of spread and extensive use, Nigerian pidgin could rightly be called a national <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">lingua franca<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">      The use of Nigerian pidgin in contemporary Nigeria could be described as most productive, extensive and complex. It appears that the standardization processes- selection, codification, elaboration of functions and acceptance-which started in the post- colonial era, are now being completed in contemporary Nigeria. The reason for this assumption is simple- apart from its complex use as a lingua franca, language of media advertisement, social interaction, unofficial military training and limited literary ouput, Nigerian pidgin has attained widespread acceptability in the media, political propaganda and campaigns as well as in the soap operas. It is also the language of radio and television jingles. Most electronic media now use appreciable percentage of their airtime to cast news and give reports in Nigerian pidgin. Even though its use in some newspaper columns has declined, especially with the demise of the &#8216;Waka About&#8217; column in the Daily Times, it is, however, found extensively in some newspaper advertisement.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">      In places like Warri Sapele and Port Harcourt, there were reports that teachers at the primary level taught their pupils in Nigerian pidgin. This unofficial adoption of Nigerian pidgin as the language of the lower primary education by those teachers is justifiable considering the provision in the National policy on Education, which states that, in addition to English the major language in the child&#8217;s environment could be used at the elementary level of education. Similarly, Nigerian pidgin had become a language of religious preaching, especially Christianity. In most rural and even urban centres where congregations are not all very well-educated, pastors resort to the use of Nigerian pidgin.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    This use of Nigerian pidgin as a literary language tends to have started in the sixties with the works of Achebe, Soyinka and others. But it is in the contemporary times that it is become most widespread. The number of poems, novels and plays written and published in Nigerian pidgin is growing even more rapidly. Many more literary writers now attempt to experiment with the language. Therefore, the evidences of codification and elaboration of functions and the partial or tactical acceptance of Nigerian pidgin are clearly visible.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">The reference to the National Policy on Education in the passage implies that <\/span><\/p>",

Naturally, Nigeria pidgin appears to be the first choice of most Nigerians in informal situations, especially when they are among those from different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds, English inclusive, Nigerian pidgin could be said to be the most widely spoken. Evidence abounds in motor parks, parties, congregations and most social occasions. There is also ample evidence in the electronic and print media, especially in political propaganda, campaigns and product advertisement. Thus, in terms of spread and extensive use, Nigerian pidgin could rightly be called a national <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">lingua franca<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">      The use of Nigerian pidgin in contemporary Nigeria could be described as most productive, extensive and complex. It appears that the standardization processes- selection, codification, elaboration of functions and acceptance-which started in the post- colonial era, are now being completed in contemporary Nigeria. The reason for this assumption is simple- apart from its complex use as a lingua franca, language of media advertisement, social interaction, unofficial military training and limited literary ouput, Nigerian pidgin has attained widespread acceptability in the media, political propaganda and campaigns as well as in the soap operas. It is also the language of radio and television jingles. Most electronic media now use appreciable percentage of their airtime to cast news and give reports in Nigerian pidgin. Even though its use in some newspaper columns has declined, especially with the demise of the &#8216;Waka About&#8217; column in the Daily Times, it is, however, found extensively in some newspaper advertisement.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">      In places like Warri Sapele and Port Harcourt, there were reports that teachers at the primary level taught their pupils in Nigerian pidgin. This unofficial adoption of Nigerian pidgin as the language of the lower primary education by those teachers is justifiable considering the provision in the National policy on Education, which states that, in addition to English the major language in the child&#8217;s environment could be used at the elementary level of education. Similarly, Nigerian pidgin had become a language of religious preaching, especially Christianity. In most rural and even urban centres where congregations are not all very well-educated, pastors resort to the use of Nigerian pidgin.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    This use of Nigerian pidgin as a literary language tends to have started in the sixties with the works of Achebe, Soyinka and others. But it is in the contemporary times that it is become most widespread. The number of poems, novels and plays written and published in Nigerian pidgin is growing even more rapidly. Many more literary writers now attempt to experiment with the language. Therefore, the evidences of codification and elaboration of functions and the partial or tactical acceptance of Nigerian pidgin are clearly visible.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">The fact that Nigerian pidgin is used in primary education in places like Warri, Sapele and Port Harcourt suggests that it is<\/span><\/p>",

This debt can be a major factor in wrecking their cars, damaging their careers, and even ruining their marriages. It can adversely affect their health and lifespan. It is a deficit that contributes to immune suppression, creating susceptibility to various infections Conditions as different as diabetes, heart disease, and extreme obesity, as well as other health problems, has been linked to it. Yet most victims are oblivious to this debt. The debtor is the one who does not have enough sleep needed for well-being. This can be caused by voluntary sleep deprivation resulting from a person&#8217;s lifestyle or by involuntary sleep deprivation because of illness and other causes. Medical researchers estimate that the earth&#8217;s population is now getting, on the average, an hour less sleep per night than what is needed. While this may seem slight, a nightly six-billion-hour debt has become the focus of research into both the variety of sleep-related illnesses and their impact on the quality of life. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    The medical world once viewed the chronic inability to sleep as just one disorder, commonly called insomnia. However, a commission created by the U.S. congress recognized 17 distinct sleep disorders. At any rate, insomnia has so many causes that it is often considered to be a symptom of other problems, much as fever suggests some sort of infection. Even occasional deprivation of sleep can be disastrous. Consider the case of Tom, although an experienced truck driver, he plunged his 18 wheel vehicle over an embankment, spilling 400 litres of sulphuric acid onto a major highway. Tom admits: &#8216;I fell asleep &#8216;Studies of two U.S. highway estimated that drowsy drivers caused some 50 percent of the fatal crashes.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">     With hundreds of thousands of sleep related auto and other accidents happening annually, the world wide cost to productivity and family is enormous. What factor may contribute to lack of sleep? One is the social phenomenon often called 24\/7 &#8211; operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The newspaper, USA Today, describes this as a cultural earthquake that is changing the way we live, noting that a new wave of round-the- clock retailers and services is profiting by <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">mocking the clock<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">. In many lands, people watch all night television programmes and access the internet when they should be sleeping. Then there is the toll taken by emotional disorders, often involving anxieties heightened by stress occasioned by the pace of life. Also there are a variety of physical diseases that can contribute to lack of sleep.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">     Many doctors note how difficult it is to get their patients to take sleep seriously. One doctor complained that chronic fatigue is even considered &#8216;a status symbol&#8217; by some. And because their condition often worsens very gradually, victims of sleep deprivation may not recognize that they suffer from a serious sleep disorder. Many of them reason, &#8216;I&#8217;m just getting old&#8217; or, &#8216;I can&#8217;t cope with life&#8217;, so I tend to shut down or, &#8216;I&#8217;m tired all the time because I can never get the long rest I need.&#8217; Reversing this sleep debt is a complex challenge. But understanding how a healthful sleep cycle works and learning to identify the signs of sleep debt can provide the motivation to change. Recognizing the symptoms of a sleep disorder can save lives, and this should be a warning to many Nigerians, particularly those engaged in long night journeys.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">Which of the following is true according to the passage?<\/span><\/p>",

This debt can be a major factor in wrecking their cars, damaging their careers, and even ruining their marriages. It can adversely affect their health and lifespan. It is a deficit that contributes to immune suppression, creating susceptibility to various infections Conditions as different as diabetes, heart disease, and extreme obesity, as well as other health problems, has been linked to it. Yet most victims are oblivious to this debt. The debtor is the one who does not have enough sleep needed for well-being. This can be caused by voluntary sleep deprivation resulting from a person&#8217;s lifestyle or by involuntary sleep deprivation because of illness and other causes. Medical researchers estimate that the earth&#8217;s population is now getting, on the average, an hour less sleep per night than what is needed. While this may seem slight, a nightly six-billion-hour debt has become the focus of research into both the variety of sleep-related illnesses and their impact on the quality of life. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    The medical world once viewed the chronic inability to sleep as just one disorder, commonly called insomnia. However, a commission created by the U.S. congress recognized 17 distinct sleep disorders. At any rate, insomnia has so many causes that it is often considered to be a symptom of other problems, much as fever suggests some sort of infection. Even occasional deprivation of sleep can be disastrous. Consider the case of Tom, although an experienced truck driver, he plunged his 18 wheel vehicle over an embankment, spilling 400 litres of sulphuric acid onto a major highway. Tom admits: &#8216;I fell asleep &#8216;Studies of two U.S. highway estimated that drowsy drivers caused some 50 percent of the fatal crashes.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">     With hundreds of thousands of sleep related auto and other accidents happening annually, the world wide cost to productivity and family is enormous. What factor may contribute to lack of sleep? One is the social phenomenon often called 24\/7 &#8211; operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The newspaper, USA Today, describes this as a cultural earthquake that is changing the way we live, noting that a new wave of round-the- clock retailers and services is profiting by <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">mocking the clock<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">. In many lands, people watch all night television programmes and access the internet when they should be sleeping. Then there is the toll taken by emotional disorders, often involving anxieties heightened by stress occasioned by the pace of life. Also there are a variety of physical diseases that can contribute to lack of sleep.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">     Many doctors note how difficult it is to get their patients to take sleep seriously. One doctor complained that chronic fatigue is even considered &#8216;a status symbol&#8217; by some. And because their condition often worsens very gradually, victims of sleep deprivation may not recognize that they suffer from a serious sleep disorder. Many of them reason, &#8216;I&#8217;m just getting old&#8217; or, &#8216;I can&#8217;t cope with life&#8217;, so I tend to shut down or, &#8216;I&#8217;m tired all the time because I can never get the long rest I need.&#8217; Reversing this sleep debt is a complex challenge. But understanding how a healthful sleep cycle works and learning to identify the signs of sleep debt can provide the motivation to change. Recognizing the symptoms of a sleep disorder can save lives, and this should be a warning to many Nigerians, particularly those engaged in long night journeys.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">From the passage, doctors find it hard to convince their patients of the gravity of lack of sleep because<\/span><\/p>",
