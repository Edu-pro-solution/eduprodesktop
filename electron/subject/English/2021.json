This way of indicating the meaning of a term by enumerating examples of what it includes is obviously of limited usefulness. If we indicated our use of the word 'animal' as above, our hearers might for example be doubtful whether a sea anemone or a slug was to be included in the class of animals. It is, however a useful way of supplementing a definition if the definition itself is definite without being easily understandable.

This way of indicating the meaning of a term by enumerating examples of what it includes is obviously of limited usefulness. If we indicated our use of the word 'animal' as above, our hearers might for example be doubtful whether a sea anemone or a slug was to be included in the class of animals. It is, however a useful way of supplementing a definition if the definition itself is definite without being easily understandable.

This way of indicating the meaning of a term by enumerating examples of what it includes is obviously of limited usefulness. If we indicated our use of the word 'animal' as above, our hearers might for example be doubtful whether a sea anemone or a slug was to be included in the class of animals. It is, however a useful way of supplementing a definition if the definition itself is definite without being easily understandable. Failure of an attempt at definition to serve its purpose may result from giving as distinguishing mark one which either does not belong to all the things the definition is intended to include, or does belong to some members of the same general class which the definition is intended to exclude.<\/span><\/p><p>Adapted from Straight and Crooked Thinking, by R.
