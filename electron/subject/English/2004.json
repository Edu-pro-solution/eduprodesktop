However, in other cases such as their effort to keep us out of contact with the difficult life&#173;- the drinking and fighting and beer-brewing and gambling- their failure was inevitable.

For one thing, in most African families, work around the home was women's work.

We lived in this way in a community in which housework was regarded as being beneath male dignity.

'It runs in the blood of your family to hate us wolves, and therefore, as we have come so conveniently together, I'll just pay off a few of your fore-fathers scores before we part.'
