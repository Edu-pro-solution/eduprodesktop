It is also a problem that every doctor shares with patients. Experts note that <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">stress is an issue everyone can relate to experientially<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">. In studying and better understanding about stress, we can derive personal as well as professional benefits.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:serif;\">     <\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">Stress can be overcome without undergoing duress. They often say anyone who wants to help someone deal with his\/ her stress should learn to handle his\/hers first .The manifestations of stress are legion. It can contribute or mimic just about any symptom you can think of. However, the main symptoms are physical, mental, emotional and behavioural. The causes of stress are multiple and varied or dying, jobs being lost or people criticizing or one becoming angry. However, most of the stress people experience is self-generated.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">     Experts tell us that we create the majority of our upsets indicating that because we cause most of our own stress, we can do something about it. This gives us a measure of choice and control that we do not always have when outside forces act on us. This also leads to a basic premise about stress reduction. To master stress- change, you have to figure what you are doing that is contributing to your problem and change it. These changes fall into behaviour, thinking lifestyle choices and\/or situations you are in . By getting to the root causes of your stress, you can prevent recurrences.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">     As a way of draining off stress energy, nothing beats aerobic exercise. To understand why, we need to review what stress is. People often think of stress as pressure at work, a demanding boss, a sick child or rush-hour traffic. These may be triggers but stress is actually the body reaction to factors such as these. Stress is the fight-or-flight response in the body, mediated by adrenaline and other stress hormones, and compromised such as physiologic changes as increased heart rate and blood pressure, faster breathing, muscle tension, dilated pupils, dry mouth and increased blood sugar. In other words, stress is the state of increased arousal necessary for an organism to defend itself at a time of danger.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">Exercise is the most logical way to dissipate the excess energy. It is what our bodies are trying to do when we pace around or tap our legs and fingers. It is much better to channel it into a more complete form of exercise like a brisk walk, a run, a bike ride, or a game of squash.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">     Just as we are all capable of mounting up and sustaining a stress reaction, we have also inherited all the physiologic events in the stress reaction are reversed. Pulse slows, blood pressure falls, breathing slows and muscles relax.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">The expression,&#8230;&#8230;stress <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">is an issue everybody can relate to experientially<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">, means that<\/span><\/p>",

It is also a problem that every doctor shares with patients. Experts note that <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">stress is an issue everyone can relate to experientially<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">. In studying and better understanding about stress, we can derive personal as well as professional benefits.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:serif;\">     <\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">Stress can be overcome without undergoing duress. They often say anyone who wants to help someone deal with his\/ her stress should learn to handle his\/hers first .The manifestations of stress are legion. It can contribute or mimic just about any symptom you can think of. However, the main symptoms are physical, mental, emotional and behavioural. The causes of stress are multiple and varied or dying, jobs being lost or people criticizing or one becoming angry. However, most of the stress people experience is self-generated.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">     Experts tell us that we create the majority of our upsets indicating that because we cause most of our own stress, we can do something about it. This gives us a measure of choice and control that we do not always have when outside forces act on us. This also leads to a basic premise about stress reduction. To master stress- change, you have to figure what you are doing that is contributing to your problem and change it. These changes fall into behaviour, thinking lifestyle choices and\/or situations you are in . By getting to the root causes of your stress, you can prevent recurrences.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">     As a way of draining off stress energy, nothing beats aerobic exercise. To understand why, we need to review what stress is. People often think of stress as pressure at work, a demanding boss, a sick child or rush-hour traffic. These may be triggers but stress is actually the body reaction to factors such as these. Stress is the fight-or-flight response in the body, mediated by adrenaline and other stress hormones, and compromised such as physiologic changes as increased heart rate and blood pressure, faster breathing, muscle tension, dilated pupils, dry mouth and increased blood sugar. In other words, stress is the state of increased arousal necessary for an organism to defend itself at a time of danger.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">Exercise is the most logical way to dissipate the excess energy. It is what our bodies are trying to do when we pace around or tap our legs and fingers. It is much better to channel it into a more complete form of exercise like a brisk walk, a run, a bike ride, or a game of squash.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">     Just as we are all capable of mounting up and sustaining a stress reaction, we have also inherited all the physiologic events in the stress reaction are reversed. Pulse slows, blood pressure falls, breathing slows and muscles relax.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">From the passage it can be deduced that stress is<\/span><\/p>",
