Man has always believed in an afterlife, but only today do we have scientific reports of people who seem to have experienced the sensation of dying but lived to tell about it. Ongoing research is documenting hundreds each year of the near-death experience (NDE) and scientists think they are finding a clearly identifiable pattern: usually a man is dying and as <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">he reaches the point of greatest physical distress<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">, he hears himself pronounced dead by his doctor. He begins to hear an uncomfortable noise ,a loud ringing or buzzing and at the same time, feels himself moving very rapidly through a dark tunnel. After this, he suddenly finds himself outside of his own physical body, but still in the immediate physical environment and he sees his own body from a distance as though he is a spectator. He watches the resuscitation attempt from his unusual vantage point and is in a state of emotional upheaval.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">     After a while, he collects himself and becomes more accustomed to this odd condition. He notices that he still has a &#8216;body&#8217;, but one of a very different nature and with very different powers from the physical body he has left behind. Soon after, things begin to happen. Others come to meet and to help him. He glimpses the spirits of relatives and friends who have already died and a loving, warm spirit of a kind he has never encountered before-a being of light- appears before him. This being asks him a question non-verbally- to make him evaluate his life- and helps him along by showing him <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">a panoramic instantaneous playback of the major events of his life.<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\"> Then he finds that he must go back to earth, that the time for his death has not yet come. At this point, he resists, for by now he is taken up by his experiences in the afterlife and does not want to return. He is overwhelmed by intense feelings of joy, love and peace. Despite his attitude, though, he somehow reunites  with his physical body and lives.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">Adapted from Moody, R. A.

Man has always believed in an afterlife, but only today do we have scientific reports of people who seem to have experienced the sensation of dying but lived to tell about it. Ongoing research is documenting hundreds each year of the near-death experience (NDE) and scientists think they are finding a clearly identifiable pattern: usually a man is dying and as <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">he reaches the point of greatest physical distress<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">, he hears himself pronounced dead by his doctor. He begins to hear an uncomfortable noise ,a loud ringing or buzzing and at the same time, feels himself moving very rapidly through a dark tunnel. After this, he suddenly finds himself outside of his own physical body, but still in the immediate physical environment and he sees his own body from a distance as though he is a spectator. He watches the resuscitation attempt from his unusual vantage point and is in a state of emotional upheaval.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">     After a while, he collects himself and becomes more accustomed to this odd condition. He notices that he still has a &#8216;body&#8217;, but one of a very different nature and with very different powers from the physical body he has left behind. Soon after, things begin to happen. Others come to meet and to help him. He glimpses the spirits of relatives and friends who have already died and a loving, warm spirit of a kind he has never encountered before-a being of light- appears before him. This being asks him a question non-verbally- to make him evaluate his life- and helps him along by showing him <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">a panoramic instantaneous playback of the major events of his life.<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\"> Then he finds that he must go back to earth, that the time for his death has not yet come. At this point, he resists, for by now he is taken up by his experiences in the afterlife and does not want to return. He is overwhelmed by intense feelings of joy, love and peace. Despite his attitude, though, he somehow reunites  with his physical body and lives.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">Adapted from Moody, R. A.
