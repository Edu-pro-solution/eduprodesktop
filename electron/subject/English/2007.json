Also called avian influenza, bird flu&#8217;s vicious strain,H5NI, was spread from birds to humans and could be as deadly as HIV\/AIDS. The pandemic had ravaged many countries in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, resulting in a high death toll in livestock, but as yet with a few human casualties.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    As the pandemic made its steady spread, there was the fear that, if it ever got to Africa, the consequences would be devastating, in view of the continent&#8217;s lack of infrastructure and money to keep it in control. This fear was consequent upon African countries&#8217; unenviable response to emergencies in the past, like droughts in some shaolin countries or flooding along the coast.

Several follow-up actions had been taken to try and halt the spread of the virus in the country, such as the immediate quarantine of the affected farms, the killing and disposal of all infested and surviving birds in affected farms and restriction of movement of people in and outside such farms. Commendable as these measures were, many Nigerians still dreaded the chicken and had already excluded its meats from their menu.

Men like him ought to be treated like the drone which the bees drive out of their hives for inactivity and overdependence.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">     Every man ought to have patience and pity for poverty; but for laziness, a long whip might be better. This would be a healthy treatment for all sluggards, but there is no chance of some of them getting their full dose of this medicine, for they were born with silver spoons in their mouths, and like spoons will scarce stir their own tea unless somebody lends them a hand. They are like the proverbial dog that leaned his head against the wall to bark and, like lazy sheep; it is too much trouble for them to carry their own wool. If they could see themselves, it might by chance do them a world of good; but perhaps it would be too much trouble for them to open their eyes even if the glass were hung for them.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">     If I seem to hit hard at the sluggards, it is because I know they can bear it, for if they were seed on the threshing floor, you would thresh many days to get them out of the straw, for laziness is in their bones, and will show itself in their idle flesh, no matter what you do with them.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">The expression if <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">the shower should turn to beer, he might wake himself up a bit<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\"> suggests that lazy people<\/span><\/p>",
