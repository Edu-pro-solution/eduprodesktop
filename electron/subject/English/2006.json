First there is the paper which set out to give a brief resume of the news and backs this up by well-written articles on current affairs by leading writers and experts. Secondly, there is the 'daily' which caters for popular taste and contains only the most sensational and exciting bit of news, supporting them with comic strips, pictures, children's corners, women's sections and readers' letters on anything but weighty topics. Thirdly, there is the propaganda type of paper, which presents only those versions of the news which agree with its own particular political outlook. All this gives news in different ways; but what deeper function can the ideal daily paper have?<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    In the case of the Nigerian daily newspapers, the first type gives the thinking reader an unbiased view of the world situation, so that he can judge the importance of recent events himself, but it does not indicate to him what he ought to think. The drawback of this is the semi-literate or uneducated find it dull or difficult and so are discouraged from reading such a paper regularly because it demands too much thought from them. The main advantage of this type of paper, however is its soundness, excellent English expression and general effect of widening the readers knowledge on a variety of subjects.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    The second type interests the majority and gives them the more striking items of news in an easily comprehensive way, accompanied by lavish photographs and usually with some slight political bias towards the left and the interests of working class, from which most of its readers come. The drawback of this type is that there is enough solid thinking matter and the English is often faulty in style- tending towards' journalese'. The advantage is that it is quickly and easily read, on the bus or train or over the breakfast table, and gives a superficial knowledge of current affairs to people who would not have the time or inclination to read 'heavier' literature.

No longer content with their traditional roles as house wives and mothers, the women have joined together to create a kind of women liberation movement, first under the umbrella of WRAPA, an acronym for Women's Rights and Privileges Agency, and later under several other bodies including non-governmental agencies like Women in Nigeria (WIN), Association of Northern Women in Science and Technology (ANWIST) and Convention for the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). A whole federal ministry called Ministry for Women Affairs has been established since 1995 for the development and advancement of Nigerian women towards what they call 'gender equality'.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    Through all these bodies, Nigerian women hope to acquire the freedom to pursue interests outside the home, like the opportunity to acquire an education or pursue a career, instead of spending all the time doing housework.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    The effects of the changes brought about by these bodies are already being felt in some families. For instance, the traditional husband-wife relationship appears to be undergoing a radical transformation. Because so many women are now working, men are learning to share the household task of cooking, cleaning and even caring for the children. In some families, there appears to be a complete reversal of the traditional roles: the husband stays at home while the wife earns the family's income. It should be pointed out however, that this is the exception not the rule.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">   The effects of women's liberation are being felt not only in the home but also on the job. More and more women are working and they are demanding equal responsible positions. It is not uncommon these days for women to head major government ministries and parastatals. Many businesses now encourage women to advance to high management positions and every year, the nation's higher institutions produce more women doctors, lawyers and accountants.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">   Politics and government are other areas that are feeling the impact of the women's movement. Although Nigerians do not appear ready to accept a woman president, women are already being elected to public offices in increasing numbers as senators and members of the national and state assemblies. Although Nigeria is yet to have a woman governor, which is the highest office in a state, there have been a few women deputy governors and house speakers. A few years ago, this would have been unthinkable.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">   In conclusion, women in Nigeria are acquiring greater independence which is<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:serif;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">causing sweeping changes<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\"> in the society at home, at work and in politics. Some men may not be happy with these changes but the women are always quick to point out that it was they, the men, who created the conditions leading to the reaction of the women.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">One argument in support of women's liberation is that it<\/span><\/p>",

No longer content with their traditional roles as house wives and mothers, the women have joined together to create a kind of women liberation movement, first under the umbrella of WRAPA, an acronym for Women's Rights and Privileges Agency, and later under several other bodies including non-governmental agencies like Women in Nigeria (WIN), Association of Northern Women in Science and Technology (ANWIST) and Convention for the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). A whole federal ministry called Ministry for Women Affairs has been established since 1995 for the development and advancement of Nigerian women towards what they call 'gender equality'.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    Through all these bodies, Nigerian women hope to acquire the freedom to pursue interests outside the home, like the opportunity to acquire an education or pursue a career, instead of spending all the time doing housework.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    The effects of the changes brought about by these bodies are already being felt in some families. For instance, the traditional husband-wife relationship appears to be undergoing a radical transformation. Because so many women are now working, men are learning to share the household task of cooking, cleaning and even caring for the children. In some families, there appears to be a complete reversal of the traditional roles: the husband stays at home while the wife earns the family's income. It should be pointed out however, that this is the exception not the rule.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">   The effects of women's liberation are being felt not only in the home but also on the job. More and more women are working and they are demanding equal responsible positions. It is not uncommon these days for women to head major government ministries and parastatals. Many businesses now encourage women to advance to high management positions and every year, the nation's higher institutions produce more women doctors, lawyers and accountants.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">   Politics and government are other areas that are feeling the impact of the women's movement. Although Nigerians do not appear ready to accept a woman president, women are already being elected to public offices in increasing numbers as senators and members of the national and state assemblies. Although Nigeria is yet to have a woman governor, which is the highest office in a state, there have been a few women deputy governors and house speakers. A few years ago, this would have been unthinkable.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">   In conclusion, women in Nigeria are acquiring greater independence which is<\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:serif;\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">causing sweeping changes<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\"> in the society at home, at work and in politics. Some men may not be happy with these changes but the women are always quick to point out that it was they, the men, who created the conditions leading to the reaction of the women.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">Which of the following statements is true according to the passage?<\/span><\/p>",
