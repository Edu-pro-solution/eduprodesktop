At each of these levels, a linguistic system comprises a number of subsystems which make up its structure. Thus a language may also be described as a system of systems. At the level of phonetics and phonology, a language selects from a general pool of speech sounds, a finite number of vocal sounds which are combined and used for its communicative and other purposes.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    Looking at the human vocal organs, it appears that their primary functions are biological. Even though they are also used for breathing, chewing, cutting, swallowing and smelling, they have been adapted for the production of the speech sounds of any human language.

This is what makes each language unique as systematic patterns of structure, and perhaps why English uses forty sound systems, French forty, Italian twenty-seven, Yoruba twenty-seven and Hawaiian only thirteen.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    There are four basic approaches to the study of speech sounds. These are articulatory, acoustic, auditory and forensic. Articulatory phonetics studies how speech sounds are made or articulated.

At each of these levels, a linguistic system comprises a number of subsystems which make up its structure. Thus a language may also be described as a system of systems.

Approximately one per cent of the population develops the disease during their lifetime. Although schizophrenia affects men and women with equal frequency, the disorder often appears earlier in men, usually in the late teens or early twenties, than in women, who are generally affected in the twenties, to early thirties. People with the disorder often suffer terrifying symptoms such as hearing internal voices not heard by others or believing that other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts or plotting to harm them. These symptoms may leave them fearful and withdrawn. Children over the age of five can develop the disease, but it is very rare before adolescence.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    People with schizophrenia may have perceptions of reality that are strikingly different from one seen and shared by others around them. <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">Living in a world distorted by hallucinations<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\"> and delusions, individuals with the disease may feel frightened, anxious and confused. Hallucinations are perceptions that occur without connection to an appropriate source. Delusions are false personal beliefs that are not subject to reason or contradictory evidence.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    Substance abuse is a common concern of the family and friends of people with schizophrenia as it can reduce the effectiveness of treatment of the disease. Stimulants such as cocaine and marijuana may cause major problems for patients with schizophrenia. In fact, some people experience a worsening of the symptoms when they take such drugs. Substance abuse also reduces the likelihood that patients will follow the treatment plans recommended by their doctors.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    The most common form of substance used disorder in people with schizophrenia is nicotine dependence due to smoking. Quitting smoking may be especially difficult for people with schizophrenia because the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal may cause a temporary worsening of the disorder symptoms. However, smoking cessation strategies that include nicotine replacement methods may be effective. Doctors should carefully monitor medication dosage and response when patients with the disease either start or stop smoking. The large majority of people with the disease show substantial improvement when treated with antipsychotic drugs. Some patients however are not helped very much by the medications and a few do not seem to need them. It is difficult to predict which patients will fall into these two groups. Antipsychotic drugs, like virtually all medications, have unwanted effects along with other symptoms. During the early phases of drug treatment, patients may be troubled by side effects such as drowsiness, restlessness, tremor, dry mouth or blurring of vision. Most of these can be corrected by lowering the dosage or controlled by other medications.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">One conclusion that can be drawn from the first paragraph is that<\/span><\/p>",

Quitting smoking may be especially difficult for people with schizophrenia because the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal may cause a temporary worsening of the disorder symptoms. However, smoking cessation strategies that include nicotine replacement methods may be effective. Doctors should carefully monitor medication dosage and response when patients with the disease either start or stop smoking. The large majority of people with the disease show substantial improvement when treated with antipsychotic drugs. Some patients however are not helped very much by the medications and a few do not seem to need them. It is difficult to predict which patients will fall into these two groups. Antipsychotic drugs, like virtually all medications, have unwanted effects along with other symptoms. During the early phases of drug treatment, patients may be troubled by side effects such as drowsiness, restlessness, tremor, dry mouth or blurring of vision. Most of these can be corrected by lowering the dosage or controlled by other medications.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">Which of the following is true according to the passage?<\/span><\/p>",

Children over the age of five can develop the disease, but it is very rare before adolescence.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    People with schizophrenia may have perceptions of reality that are strikingly different from one seen and shared by others around them. <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">Living in a world distorted by hallucinations<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\"> and delusions, individuals with the disease may feel frightened, anxious and confused. Hallucinations are perceptions that occur without connection to an appropriate source. Delusions are false personal beliefs that are not subject to reason or contradictory evidence.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    Substance abuse is a common concern of the family and friends of people with schizophrenia as it can reduce the effectiveness of treatment of the disease. Stimulants such as cocaine and marijuana may cause major problems for patients with schizophrenia. In fact, some people experience a worsening of the symptoms when they take such drugs. Substance abuse also reduces the likelihood that patients will follow the treatment plans recommended by their doctors.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    The most common form of substance used disorder in people with schizophrenia is nicotine dependence due to smoking. Quitting smoking may be especially difficult for people with schizophrenia because the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal may cause a temporary worsening of the disorder symptoms. However, smoking cessation strategies that include nicotine replacement methods may be effective. Doctors should carefully monitor medication dosage and response when patients with the disease either start or stop smoking. The large majority of people with the disease show substantial improvement when treated with antipsychotic drugs. Some patients however are not helped very much by the medications and a few do not seem to need them. It is difficult to predict which patients will fall into these two groups. Antipsychotic drugs, like virtually all medications, have unwanted effects along with other symptoms. During the early phases of drug treatment, patients may be troubled by side effects such as drowsiness, restlessness, tremor, dry mouth or blurring of vision. Most of these can be corrected by lowering the dosage or controlled by other medications.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">The expression <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">living in a world distorted by hallucinations<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\"> means<\/span><\/p>",
