Good music provides entertainment and emotional release and it accompanies activities ranging from dances to religious ceremonies. Music is heard everywhere; in auditoriums, homes, elevators, schools, sports arenas and on the streets. Recorded performance is a sensational innovation of the twentieth century. Thanks to modern technology like compact disc (CD), digital video disc (DVD) and the MP3 player, music can now be heard in diverse places. Such places include living rooms and cars. Jogging paths can also function as new kinds of concert halls where we can hear what we want as often as we want.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">      Live performances provide a special excitement. In a live performance, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:serif;\">artists put themselves on the line<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">. To avoid embarrassment, the artist must train beforehand and ensure that technical difficulties are avoided and that the listeners are actively involved. What is performed, how it sounds and how the artistes feel that evening exist for a fleeting moment and can never be repeated. An audience responds to the excitement of such a moment and feelings are exchanged between <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">stage and hall.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">      Our response to a musical performance or an artist is subjective and rooted in deep feelings. Even professional critics can differ strongly in their evaluations of a performance. There is no one 'truth' about what we hear and feel. Does the performer project a concept, an overall idea, or an emotion? Do some sections of a piece, but not others, communicate something to you? Can you figure out why? It is up to us as listeners to evaluate performances of music. Alert and repeated listening will enhance our ability to compare performances and judge music so that we can fully enjoy it. People listen to music in many different ways. For instance, music can be a barely perceived background as in a film or a totally absorbing experience as in a concert.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\"> Which of the following is true according to the passage?<\/span><\/p>",

Good music provides entertainment and emotional release and it accompanies activities ranging from dances to religious ceremonies. Music is heard everywhere; in auditoriums, homes, elevators, schools, sports arenas and on the streets. Recorded performance is a sensational innovation of the twentieth century. Thanks to modern technology like compact disc (CD), digital video disc (DVD) and the MP3 player, music can now be heard in diverse places. Such places include living rooms and cars. Jogging paths can also function as new kinds of concert halls where we can hear what we want as often as we want.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">      Live performances provide a special excitement. In a live performance, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;font-family:serif;\">artists put themselves on the line<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">. To avoid embarrassment, the artist must train beforehand and ensure that technical difficulties are avoided and that the listeners are actively involved. What is performed, how it sounds and how the artistes feel that evening exist for a fleeting moment and can never be repeated. An audience responds to the excitement of such a moment and feelings are exchanged between <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">stage and hall.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">      Our response to a musical performance or an artist is subjective and rooted in deep feelings. Even professional critics can differ strongly in their evaluations of a performance. There is no one 'truth' about what we hear and feel. Does the performer project a concept, an overall idea, or an emotion? Do some sections of a piece, but not others, communicate something to you? Can you figure out why? It is up to us as listeners to evaluate performances of music. Alert and repeated listening will enhance our ability to compare performances and judge music so that we can fully enjoy it. People listen to music in many different ways. For instance, music can be a barely perceived background as in a film or a totally absorbing experience as in a concert.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">According to the passage, music plays a vital role in human society because<\/span><\/p>",
