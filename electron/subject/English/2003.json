So when the Super Eagles of Nigeria filed out against Argentina on the morning of Sunday, June the second, 2002, many Nigerian football enthusiasts delayed attending church service to watch the match live on the television. As expected, the Super Eagles put up strong resistance to the Argentinean challenge and the day would not have ended on a somber note for Nigerians if the momentum had been sustained throughout the match.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    The hope of going beyond the first round, though precarious, was very much alive as the Eagles were expected to defeat their next opponents, Sweden and England. But some shortcomings in the Nigerian national team needed to be rectified to brighten their chances against their next opponents.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    First, the defense needed to be strengthened to prevent the opponents from incessantly terrorizing the goal keeper. Then the strikers also needed to improve on their lackluster performance against Argentina, since every Nigerian expected them to overwhelm their next opponents in the opening rounds.

Nobody had given the Senegalese any chance against the star studded defending champions but the 1-0 score line in favor of Senegal showed that African football can no longer be taken for granted.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    This shocking defeat of France had raised Arica's hopes of going beyond the first of the tournament. So when the Super Eagles of Nigeria filed out against Argentina on the morning of Sunday, June the second, 2002, many Nigerian football enthusiasts delayed attending church service to watch the match live on the television. As expected, the Super Eagles put up strong resistance to the Argentinean challenge and the day would not have ended on a somber note for Nigerians if the momentum had been sustained throughout the match.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    The hope of going beyond the first round, though precarious, was very much alive as the Eagles were expected to defeat their next opponents, Sweden and England. But some shortcomings in the Nigerian national team needed to be rectified to brighten their chances against their next opponents.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    First, the defense needed to be strengthened to prevent the opponents from incessantly terrorizing the goal keeper. Then the strikers also needed to improve on their lackluster performance against Argentina, since every Nigerian expected them to overwhelm their next opponents in the opening rounds. Lastly, rather than gamble with unfit players, a more creative use of the reserves would be necessary to smooth the way to the next round.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">    If World Cup <\/span><span style=\"font-style:italic;font-family:serif;\">debutants<\/span><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">, Senegal, could nurse the hope of playing in the knock-out stages of the tournament, then the Eagles should soar instead of being intimidated by big names, for no team is invincible.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-family:serif;\">From the passage, it can be concluded that the writer<\/span><\/p>",

Some have refrained from smoking and those who could influence others, such as parents and religious leaders, have also exerted their influence to prevent others from smoking.

The African moralist, basing his judgment on the behaviour of a few alcoholics, tends to regard the habit of taking alcohol as a sign of wretchedness. The moralist holds the view that anybody who forms the habit of consuming alcohol, will never do well in life. While this may be true in respect of a few people in the society, the fear of the moralist has been justified. However, the economist is primarily interested in the habit of smoking and the consumption of alcohol in so far as they give satisfaction to smokers and drinkers and so generate supply of and demand for tobacco and alcohol. The economist is interested in knowing how many packets of cigarettes are consumed and to what extent an increase or fall in consumption could affect production, that is, supply.

Some have refrained from smoking and those who could influence others, such as parents and religious leaders, have also exerted their influence to prevent others from smoking. On the other hand, a good many people have remained indifferent to the moralist view and have continued to smoke. The same argument has been applied to the consumption of alcohol. The African moralist, basing his judgment on the behaviour of a few alcoholics, tends to regard the habit of taking alcohol as a sign of wretchedness. The moralist holds the view that anybody who forms the habit of consuming alcohol, will never do well in life. While this may be true in respect of a few people in the society, the fear of the moralist has been justified. However, the economist is primarily interested in the habit of smoking and the consumption of alcohol in so far as they give satisfaction to smokers and drinkers and so generate supply of and demand for tobacco and alcohol. The economist is interested in knowing how many packets of cigarettes are consumed and to what extent an increase or fall in consumption could affect production, that is, supply. Similarly, he is interested in how much beer is consumed and how the supply of beer will adjust to the demand for it.
